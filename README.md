Homework for Unit 4 for 6306 Doing Data Science

This repository contains Rmd, md, and html files for homework for Unit 4 in 6306 Doing Data Science.

The md file takes a random normal distribution of 50 samples, and then bootstraps for 1000 iterations, and compares the histograms
between the original sample and the means of the 1000 samples taken from the original sample.

It then does the same thing but with 10 samples in the original random normal distribution set.

After that, it takes an exponential distribution of 50 samples with a rate of 0.5, and bootstraps for 1000 iterations, and compares
the histograms between the original sample and the means of the 1000 samples taken from the original sample.

Finally, it does the same as the previous exponential distribution set, but this time it takes 8 samples with a rate of 0.5 as its
original sample.
